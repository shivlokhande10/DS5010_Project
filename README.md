This machine learning package is designed to analyze and predict traffic accident severity using a comprehensive set of data points. By examining historical data, the package identifies patterns and factors that contribute to severe accidents. This analysis includes environmental conditions like weather and lighting, traffic patterns such as vehicle density and flow, and driver behavior traits including speed and erratic movements. The aim is to provide government bodies, road safety organizations, and stakeholders with valuable insights to implement targeted interventions for enhancing road safety and optimizing emergency responses. By focusing on these areas, the package can not only maintain but also extend its relevance and utility in the rapidly evolving field of traffic management and road safety. These enhancements will ensure that the package remains at the cutting edge of technology and continues to provide valuable insights and recommendations to mitigate traffic accidents effectively.![image](https://github.com/shivlokhande10/DS5010_Project/assets/164388693/8fa5557b-93d1-4968-94e7-d02a5566302a)
